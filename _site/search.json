    "text": "Thailand has some of the most dangerous roads in the world, with around 20,000 people dying in road accidents each year—about 56 deaths a day, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This makes road safety a critical issue in the country. Geospatial analytics can help by mapping where accidents happen, what types of roads are most dangerous, and identifying risk factors. By using this data, authorities can focus on improving dangerous areas, making roads safer, and planning better traffic enforcement. In a country with such high accident rates, geospatial analysis is a powerful tool to help reduce fatalities and protect lives.\nThis Take-Home Exercise attempts to:\n\nVisualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of road traffic accidents in BMR using appropriate statistical graphics and geovisualization methods.\nConduct detailed spatial analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatio-temporal analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Temporal Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods."

It filters out rows with missing or empty longitude and latitude values and then keeps only accidents that occurred in specific provinces around the Bangkok Metropolitan Region.\nIt then converts the data into a spatial object (sf), assigning geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) in the WGS 84 coordinate system (EPSG:4326) and transforms it to UTM zone 47N (EPSG:32647) for further spatial analysis.\n\nrdacc_sf &lt;- read_csv(\"data/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv\") %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude) & longitude != \"\",\n         !is.na(latitude) & latitude !=\"\") %&gt;%\n  filter(province_en %in% c('Bangkok', 'Samut Prakan', 'Pathum Thani', 'Nonthaburi', 'Nakhon Pathom', 'Samut Sakhon' )) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords= c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n           crs=4326) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=32647)\n\n\n\nROAD NETWORK DATA\nNext dataset we will import is the road network data.\nI filtered the road data based on a list of highway classifications from the WikiProject Thailand page, which includes road types such as ‘motorway,’ ‘trunk,’ ‘primary,’ and others. I chose only the highways which provide access to various types of vehicles, including motorcars, motorcycles, goods vehicles, heavy goods vehicles (HGV), and public service vehicles (PSV).\n\n\nLoading this dataset shows that there are 1551498 records.

This will return only the parts of the road network that are within the boundaries (which is filtered to only “Bangkok”).\nEssentially, this step ensures that only the roads within Bangkok are retained, and any road segments outside the specified boundaries are excluded from the result stored in diff and diff_residential.\n\nChecking the buffer for accidents in both expressway (non-residential) and residential areas reveals that non-residential areas have around 6,075 accidents, while residential areas have around 2,397 accidents. This indicates that there are significantly more accidents occurring near expressways compared to residential areas, suggesting that high-traffic roads, such as expressways, may be more prone to accidents despite the higher population density in residential zones.\n\nLet’s use diff and not diff_residential in the calculation of NKDE and TKNDE, meaning we are not using residential data to check for hotspot areas for traffic accidents in Bangkok.\n\nthroad_filtered &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data/hotosm_tha_roads_lines_shp\", layer = \"hotosm_tha_roads_lines_shp\") %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(geometry)) %&gt;%\n  filter(highway %in% c('motorway', 'motorway_link', 'trunk', 'trunk_link', \n                        'primary', 'primary_link', 'secondary', 'secondary_link', \n                        'tertiary', 'tertiary_link', 'unclassified', 'living_street', \n                        'road'))\n\n\nthroad_filtered &lt;- st_set_crs(throad_filtered, 4326)\nthroad_filtered &lt;- st_transform(throad_filtered, 32647)\nboundaries &lt;- st_transform(boundaries, 32647)\n\n\ndiff &lt;- st_intersection(throad_filtered, boundaries)\n\nFor the next two code chunks, they provide additional insights and essentially emphasize the greater need to focus on non-residential areas, rather than residential ones, as they highlight the higher frequency of accidents in these high-traffic regions.

The varying bandwidths reveal different levels of data smoothness, where smaller bandwidths capture more abrupt fluctuations in accident occurrences, potentially highlighting seasonal spikes or specific events. Larger bandwidths smooth out these details, indicating broader trends, such as increased accidents during peak tourist seasons or major festivals like Songkran, which are obscured in higher bandwidth plots."
