# 1. OVERVIEW

Thailand has some of the most dangerous roads in the world, with around 20,000 people dying in road accidents each year—about 56 deaths a day, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This makes road safety a critical issue in the country. Geospatial analytics can help by mapping where accidents happen, what types of roads are most dangerous, and identifying risk factors. By using this data, authorities can focus on improving dangerous areas, making roads safer, and planning better traffic enforcement. In a country with such high accident rates, geospatial analysis is a powerful tool to help reduce fatalities and protect lives.

This Take-Home Exercise attempts to:

-   Visualize the **spatio-temporal dynamics** of road traffic accidents in BMR using appropriate statistical graphics and geovisualization methods.

-   Conduct **detailed** **spatial analysis** of road traffic accidents using appropriate Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.

-   To conduct **detailed spatio-temporal analysis** of road traffic accidents using appropriate Temporal Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.

# 2. GETTING STARTED

## 2.1 Installing the R Packages

This code chunk uses `p_load()` of the ***pacman*** package (stands for Package Manager) to check if the following packages are installed in the computer. The packages will then be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, tmap, ggplot2, ggstatsplot, dplyr, spatstat, raster, readxl, spNetwork, rgeos, future, future.apply, RColorBrewer, RcppArmadillo)
```

## 2.2 Importing the Datasets

This Take-Home Exercise will utilize 3 datasets. They are:

-   [Thailand Road Accident \[2019-2022\]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-road-accident-2019-2022) on Kaggle

-   [Thailand Roads (OpenStreetMap Export)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tha_roads) on HDX.

-   [Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?) on HDX.

Let's use the ***sf*** package to import the datasets as ***sf*** data frames.

### BOUNDARIES DATA

Let's import the boundaries data using the code chunk below. This will filter out the boundaries in the different provinces under the Bangkok Metropolitan Region.

```{r}
#| eval: false
boundaries <- st_read(dsn = "data/tha_adm_rtsd_itos_20210121_shp", layer = "tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121") %>%
  filter(!is.na(geometry)) %>%
  filter(ADM1_EN %in% c('Bangkok', 'Samut Prakan', 'Pathum Thani', 'Nonthaburi', 'Nakhon Pathom', 'Samut Sakhon' ))
```

### ROAD ACCIDENT DATA

This code chunk reads the CSV file of road accident data for Thailand. It filters out rows with missing or empty longitude and latitude values and then keeps only accidents that occurred in specific provinces around the Bangkok Metropolitan Region.

It then converts the data into a spatial object (`sf`), assigning geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) in the WGS 84 coordinate system (EPSG:4326) and transforms it to UTM zone 47N (EPSG:32647) for further spatial analysis.

```{r}
#| eval: false
rdacc_sf <- read_csv("data/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv") %>%
  filter(!is.na(longitude) & longitude != "",
         !is.na(latitude) & latitude !="") %>%
  filter(province_en %in% c('Bangkok', 'Samut Prakan', 'Pathum Thani', 'Nonthaburi', 'Nakhon Pathom', 'Samut Sakhon' )) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords= c("longitude", "latitude"),
           crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs=32647)
```

### ROAD NETWORK DATA

Next dataset we will import is the road network data.

I filtered the road data based on a list of highway classifications from the [WikiProject Thailand page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Thailand#Highway_classification), which includes road types such as 'motorway,' 'trunk,' 'primary,' and others. I chose only the highways which provide access to various types of vehicles, including motorcars, motorcycles, goods vehicles, heavy goods vehicles (HGV), and public service vehicles (PSV).

![](images/Screenshot%202024-09-21%20223326.png)

Loading this dataset shows that there are 1551498 records. That's a lot! Let us check which ones to remove in the next section.

Note! To conserve space during rendering and when committing changes, I have included only images of some of the code implementations.

# 3. GEOSPATIAL DATA WRANGLING

## 3.1 CHANGING COORDINATE SYSTEMS

This code first sets the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the `throad` dataset to EPSG:4326 (WGS 84), which is a common geographic coordinate system. Then, both the `throad` and `boundaries` datasets are transformed to the UTM Zone 47N projection (EPSG:32647), which is a local projection for Thailand that is suitable for spatial analysis and accurate distance measurements. This ensures that both datasets are in the same CRS for further spatial operations.

We have also done this at the start when we created `rdacc_sf`.

![](images/Screenshot%202024-09-21%20224633.png)

## 3.2 ROAD ACCIDENT DATA

Let's check the number of road accidents in each province listed in the `province_en` column of the `rdacc_sf` dataset.

```{r}
#| eval: false
rdacc_sf %>% count(province_en)
```

I am selecting Bangkok for analysis because it has a comparably higher number of road accidents (6,089) compared to other provinces, such as Samut Prakan (2,241) and Nakhon Pathom (891).

```{r}
#| eval: false
rdacc_sf <- rdacc_sf %>%       
  filter(province_en %in% c('Bangkok'))
```

## 3.3 BOUNDARIES DATA

Since we have already filtered the accident data to only include Bangkok, this boundary dataset must also be filtered to Bangkok to ensure consistency in the analysis.

```{r}
#| eval: false
boundaries <- st_read(dsn = "data/tha_adm_rtsd_itos_20210121_shp", layer = "tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121") %>%   filter(!is.na(geometry)) %>%   filter(ADM1_EN %in% c('Bangkok'))
```

## 3.4 ROAD NETWORK DATA

Based on the data, the category that stands out is **residential**, containing over 1 million records, while the others, typically classified as highways without many walkroads, have significantly fewer records.

![](images/Screenshot%202024-09-21%20224159.png)

To further analyze this, we will check which areas have more accidents by applying a buffer to these road types.

Basically, the goal is to check whether accidents involve accidents TO PEOPLE vs accidents BETWEEN VEHICLES.

![](images/Screenshot%202024-09-21%20224716.png)

The code chunk below performs a spatial join, specifically an intersection between the road network (`throad` and `throad_residential`)and the boundaries (`boundaries`) dataset. This will return only the parts of the road network that are within the `boundaries` (which is filtered to only "Bangkok").

Essentially, this step ensures that only the roads within Bangkok are retained, and any road segments outside the specified boundaries are excluded from the result stored in `diff` and `diff_residential.`

![](images/Screenshot%202024-09-21%20224757.png)

Checking the buffer for accidents in both expressway (non-residential) and residential areas reveals that **non-residential areas have around 6,075 accidents**, while **residential areas have around 2,397 accidents**. This indicates that there are significantly more accidents occurring near expressways compared to residential areas, suggesting that high-traffic roads, such as expressways, may be more prone to accidents despite the higher population density in residential zones.

![](images/clipboard-3840073253.png)

Let's use `diff` and not `diff_residential` in the calculation of NKDE and TKNDE, meaning we are not using residential data to check for hotspot areas for traffic accidents in Bangkok.

```{r}
#| eval: false
throad_filtered <- st_read(dsn = "data/hotosm_tha_roads_lines_shp", layer = "hotosm_tha_roads_lines_shp") %>%
  filter(!is.na(geometry)) %>%
  filter(highway %in% c('motorway', 'motorway_link', 'trunk', 'trunk_link', 
                        'primary', 'primary_link', 'secondary', 'secondary_link', 
                        'tertiary', 'tertiary_link', 'unclassified', 'living_street', 
                        'road'))
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
throad_filtered <- st_set_crs(throad_filtered, 4326)
throad_filtered <- st_transform(throad_filtered, 32647)
boundaries <- st_transform(boundaries, 32647)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
diff <- st_intersection(throad_filtered, boundaries)
```

For the next two code chunks, they provide additional insights and essentially emphasize the greater need to focus on non-residential areas, rather than residential ones, as they highlight the higher frequency of accidents in these high-traffic regions. This suggests that focusing on expressways and similar roads may yield more actionable insights than studying residential areas.

## 3.5 Saving and Writing RDS

I used `readRDS` and `writeRDS` functions to efficiently manage and preserve the exact state of R objects, ensuring that all attributes such as data types and row names are maintained accurately across sessions.

```{r}
#| eval: false
saveRDS(diff, "diff.rds")
saveRDS(rdacc_sf, "rdacc_sf.rds")
```

```{r}
diff <- readRDS("diff.rds")
rdacc_sf <- readRDS("rdacc_sf.rds")
```

# 4. VISUALIZING THE GEOSPATIAL DATA

## GENERAL

This is our final geospatial data before calculating NKDE and TNKDE. This code sets the tmap mode to interactive viewing and visualizes the road segments (`diff`) in purple and the accident points (`rdacc_sf`) in yellow.

```{r}
tmap_mode('view') 
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
tm_shape(diff) +
  tm_lines(col="lightblue", size=0.02)+
tm_shape(rdacc_sf) +
  tm_dots(col="blue", size=0.02)
```

![](images/1.png){fig-align="center"}

## BY AGENCY

Based on the map, when visualizing accidents by agency, it is clear that most are reported under the agency of the Department of Highways. In terms of policy creation and implementation, this suggests that the government can focus more on these roads and the agency’s involvement. Additionally, there is an apparent concentration of roads specific to this agency, which could be a point of investigation to understand why accidents are primarily occurring on these roads and how they can be addressed.

```{r}
#| eval: false
tm_shape(diff) +   
  tm_lines(col = "lightblue") + 
  tm_shape(rdacc_sf) +   
  tm_dots(col = "agency", palette = "Set1", size = 0.02)
```

![](images/2.png){fig-align="center"}

## BY VEHICLE

```{r}
#| eval: false
tm_shape(diff) +   
  tm_lines(col = "lightblue") + 
  tm_shape(rdacc_sf) +   
  tm_dots(col = "vehicle_type", palette = "Set1", size = 0.02)
```

![](images/3.png){fig-align="center"}

We can observe that certain colors stand out on the map, indicating potential patterns in vehicle-related accidents. The **pink dots**, representing private/passenger cars, are scattered across different areas, while the **yellow dots**, representing motorized tricycles (commonly known as **tuk tuks**, which are famous among tourists for being fast vehicles), are concentrated in the central region. This may be due to the presence of tourist spots and high-traffic areas. Given their speed, tuk tuks may have a higher chance of being involved in accidents.

![Image of a Tuk Tuk](images/Tuktuk_at_Tha_Phae_Road.jpg)

Similarly, the **orange dots**, representing motorcycles, are concentrated in the southern part of the map. These observations suggest that certain vehicle types may be more prone to accidents in specific areas, which warrants further investigation.

# 5. CALCULATING NKDE

Let's now calculate the NKDE to potentially identify hotspot areas that have high concentrations of traffic road accidents along the Bangkok City road network. We hope to specify network segments that may require attention or intervention.

```{r}
#| eval: false
lixels <- lixelize_lines(sf::st_cast(diff, "LINESTRING"),750,mindist = 375)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
samples <- lines_center(lixels)
```

In this code, **future::plan(future::multisession(workers=2))** is used to enable parallel processing, allowing the NKDE calculation to run on two separate cores (workers). This speeds up the computation by distributing the workload across multiple processors, which is particularly useful when working with large datasets and complex calculations like NKDE.

The method = "continuous" is selected because it offers the best of both worlds by providing a smooth and seamless density estimation along the road network while still capturing the detailed distribution of accidents. It ensures that there are no artificial breaks between road segments, making the analysis more accurate and realistic in representing how accidents occur across the network.

## NKDE FIXED BANDWIDTH

```{r}
#| eval: false
future::plan(future::multisession(workers=2))
densities_mc <- nkde.mc(sf::st_cast(diff, "LINESTRING"),
                        events = rdacc_sf,
                        w = rep(1,nrow(rdacc_sf)),
                        samples = samples,
                        kernel_name = "quartic",
                        bw = 300, div= "bw",
                        method = "continuous", 
                        digits = 1, tol = 1,
                        grid_shape = c(2,2),
                        max_depth = 8,agg = 10,
                        sparse = TRUE,verbose = FALSE)

if (!inherits(future::plan(), "sequential")) future::plan(future::sequential)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
samples$density <- densities_mc
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
samples$density <- samples$density*1000
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
samples2 <- samples[order(samples$density),]
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
colorRamp <- brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "Spectral") 
colorRamp <- rev(colorRamp)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
tm_shape(diff) +    
  tm_lines("black")+ 
  tm_shape(samples2) +   
  tm_dots("density", style = "kmeans", palette = colorRamp, n = 7, size = 0.04)
```

![](images/Screenshot 2024-09-22 153345.png){fig-align="center"}

The plot above reveals several red areas, indicating locations with a higher concentration of accidents. Upon closer inspection, many of these high-density areas are located at or near intersections, suggesting that intersections may be key hotspots for accidents. This highlights the need for further investigation into intersection safety and potential improvements in traffic management at these critical points.

## ADAPTIVE BANDWIDTH

```{r}
#| eval: false
adapt_densities <- nkde.mc(
  lines = sf::st_cast(diff, "LINESTRING"),
  events = rdacc_sf,
  w = rep(1, nrow(rdacc_sf)),
  samples = samples,
  kernel_name = "quartic",
  bw = 500,
  div = "bw",
  adaptive = TRUE,
  trim_bw = 1000,
  method = "discontinuous",
  digits = 1,
  tol = 5,
  grid_shape = c(2, 2),
  max_depth = 16,
  agg = 5,
  sparse = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)

if (length(adapt_densities$k) == nrow(samples)) {
  samples$density <- adapt_densities$k
} else {
  stop("Mismatch between density results and number of samples. Please check the input data.")
}
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
tm_shape(diff) +
  tm_lines("black")+ 
  tm_shape(samples) +
  tm_dots("density", style = "kmeans", palette = colorRamp, n = 7, size = 0.04)
```

![](images/Screenshot 2024-09-22 155910.png){fig-align="center"}

In the adaptive bandwidth density plot, no red areas are observed, indicating that the density of accidents is more evenly distributed. The adaptive bandwidth adjusts to local conditions, smoothing the density in areas with fewer accidents and concentrating on high-density areas, which may explain the absence of extreme hotspots. This approach provides a more balanced view of accident distribution across the network, but it may also mask the intensity of certain critical areas, such as intersections, which were more visible in the fixed bandwidth plot.
