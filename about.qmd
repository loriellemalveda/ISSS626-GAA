Welcome to my website! I'm currently a student with a deep interest in geospatial analysis and its vast applications. This site serves as a platform for sharing my projects, insights, and learnings in the field of geospatial studies, from mapping to spatial data analysis.

With a focus on using tools like R and various geospatial libraries, I explore topics such as geospatial data visualization, network analysis, and environmental mapping. My goal is to deepen my understanding of how spatial data can influence decision-making in areas like urban planning, transportation, and environmental sustainability.

I invite you to explore my work and join me on this journey into the fascinating world of geospatial science!
